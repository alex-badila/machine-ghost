# machine-ghost
A site that sells cyberpunk media, such as DVD's and books. It uses a grid format to display the products it sells. It is a responsive page, scaling as the screen changes. Each product has a button to buy, which, when clicked, adds the price with tax to the total at the bottom of the page. The buttons have rounded corners and a linear gradient that goes from black to blue. Hovering over the image makes it grow. The cyberpunk font Glitch Goblin was used for the text. The main heading has a text shadow that is grey. The site is optimized for SEO. It has a meta description, all the images have alt text, and header, main, section, and footer tags are used instead of divs. Both the intro and grid footer text have a border around them. All the text outside the grid is centered.
